#### RESEARCH PROJECTS

  - **Genome-wide CRISPR Screening** \[1 and several additional
    manuscripts under preparation\]
    
    *Short description*: Genome-wide CRISPR screening, developed by Feng
    Zhang, Broad Institute, MIT, is a powerful tool to investigate the
    regulators for proteins, cell behaviors, diseases, or drug targets.
    After delivering a pool of sgRNA into cells with the help of
    lentivirus, cells are screened according to protein levels, cell
    behaviors, or drug resistances. The sgRNA cassettes within the cells
    are then sequenced, giving information about potential regulators.
    With expanding knowledge of CRISPR-Cas9 systems, this technology is
    promising in pharmacy, diagnosis and biomedical research.
    
    *Roles*: genome-editing, cell culture, flow cytometry, DNA library
    preparation, GO analysis, gene pathway analysis, data processing,
    data interpretation

  - **New Technology Development** \[manuscript under preparation\]
    
    *Short description*: Genome-wide association of SNP (GWAS) is a
    powerful technology to discover disease associated SNPs. However,
    due to the limitations of GWAS, SNPs identified by GWAS may not be
    functional. New technologies are needed to find causal SNPs. We are
    developing a new technology to screen potential causal SNPs. This
    technology has great potential in linking functional genomic
    elements to diseases, or developing novel SNPs with potential
    applications in diagnosis.
    
    *Roles*: unbiased DNA amplification, cloning, PAGE (polyacrylamide
    gel electrophoresis) purification, DNA library preparation, data
    interpretation

  - **Analysis of cardiovascular co-morbidities of diabetes** \[2, 6, 7,
    8\]
    
    According to epidemic studies, half of diabetes patients will
    develop cardiovascular diseases. However, the prognosis varies from
    person to person. Molecular markers, SNPs can be powerful in
    predicting the clinical implications of diabetes patients with heart
    diseases. In this project, we used both clinical study, GWAS data
    analysis, and gene functional study to find clues in evaluating the
    outcomes of such patients.
    
    *Roles*: GWAS data processing, cell culture, functional study,
    clinical cross-sectional study, data collection and cleaning,
    stepwise multivariate regression, ROC curve

  - **Functional study of dysregulated proteins in hepatocellular
    carcinoma** \[3, 4, 5\]
    
    Protein expression are dramatically changed in malignant tumor
    cells. Dysregulation of some essential proteins, such as P53,
    contributes greatly in the progression of many kinds of cancers. In
    this project, we assessed several misrepresented proteins on the
    cell growth, apoptosis of liver cancer cell lines in vitro.
    
    *Roles*: genome editing, virus culturing, bacteria culturing, flow
    cytometry, DNA transfection, meta-analysis of gene-expression, viral
    DNA and RNA quantification, in-vivo protein half-life analysis,
    co-immunoprecipitation
